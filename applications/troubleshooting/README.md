## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Ensure your cluster is running**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
   ```

2. **Start with Exercise 1** - Cluster Component Troubleshooting

3. **Practice breaking things** and then fixing them

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **This is 30% of the exam** - focus heavily on troubleshooting
- **Practice breaking things** - create problems to solve
- **Learn systematic approaches** - don't guess randomly
- **Master kubectl commands** - they're your primary tools
- **Understand error messages** - they often contain the solution
- **Time your practice** - troubleshooting is time-sensitive on the exam

## üéØ Exam Strategy

### Time Allocation (30% = 54 minutes)
- **Quick diagnosis**: 10 minutes
- **Root cause analysis**: 20 minutes
- **Solution implementation**: 20 minutes
- **Verification**: 4 minutes

### Common Troubleshooting Flow
1. **Check status** - `kubectl get` and `kubectl describe`
2. **Check logs** - `kubectl logs` and component logs
3. **Check events** - `kubectl get events`
4. **Check resources** - CPU, memory, disk, network
5. **Check configuration** - YAML validation and settings
6. **Implement fix** - apply the solution
7. **Verify** - confirm the problem is resolved

### Key Commands to Master
- `kubectl describe` - detailed object information
- `kubectl logs` - container and component logs
- `kubectl exec` - execute commands in containers
- `kubectl get events` - cluster events and errors
- `kubectl top` - resource usage monitoring
- `kubectl explain` - API documentation
