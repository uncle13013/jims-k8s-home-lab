## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Verify your 2-node cluster is running**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
   ```

2. **Check cluster health**:
   ```bash
   kubectl cluster-info
   kubectl get componentstatuses
   ```

3. **Start with Exercise 1** - Cluster Health Verification

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Practice on your local cluster** - don't break production systems
- **Document your steps** - this helps with exam preparation
- **Time your exercises** - simulate exam conditions
- **Focus on troubleshooting** - things will break, learn to fix them
