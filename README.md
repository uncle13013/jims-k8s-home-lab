## üèõÔ∏è Legacy Infrastructure (Preserved for Reference)

### Multi-Machine Setup (Previous Version)
The project previously used a 6-node setup across two physical machines but has been simplified to a local 2-node setup for focused CKA exam study.

**Previous Architecture**:
- **HP Omen Laptop**: 4 worker nodes (2GB each)
- **Toshiba Satellite**: 1 master (4GB) + 1 worker (6GB)
- **Total**: 6 nodes, 12 vCPUs, 18GB RAM

**Simplification Rationale**:
- **Focused learning**: Local setup allows for concentrated CKA study
- **Resource efficiency**: Reduced resource consumption for learning
- **Faster iteration**: Quicker deployment and testing cycles
- **Portability**: Easy to move between different learning environments
